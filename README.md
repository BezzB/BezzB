## Leaderboard-Setup

I recently completed the Leaderboard-Setup project, which is available on my GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/BezzB/Leaderboard-setup).

The project is a leaderboard that displays scores fetched from an API using JavaScript. I utilized DOM manipulation, asynchronous programming, and API integration to create a dynamic web application that presents the data in an organized and visually appealing way.

The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is optimized for responsiveness across different devices. The code is well-structured and easy to read, with descriptive variable names and comments that explain the logic behind the code.

I also added error handling and loading animations to improve the user experience and make the application more user-friendly.

Overall, the Leaderboard-Setup project demonstrates my proficiency in web development and showcases my ability to create dynamic and responsive web applications. I am excited to continue building my skills and contributing to innovative projects in the future.
